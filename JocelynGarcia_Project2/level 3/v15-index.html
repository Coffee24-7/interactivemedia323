      		<p>From childhood's hour I have not been  As others were I have not seen  As others saw I could not bring </p>
            
            <p>My passions from a common spring  From the same source I have not taken  My sorrow I could not awaken </p>
            
            <p>My heart to joy at the same tone  And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone  Then in my childhood in the dawn </p>
            
            <p>Of a most stormy life was drawn  From ev'ry depth of good and ill  The mystery which binds me still </p>
            
            <p>From the torrent, or the fountain  From the red cliff of the mountain  From the sun that 'round me roll'd </p>
            
            <p>In its autumn tint of gold  From the lightning in the sky  As it pass'd me flying by</p>
            
            <p>From the thunder, and the storm  And the cloud that took the form  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)</p> 
            
            <p>Of a demon in my view.</p>
