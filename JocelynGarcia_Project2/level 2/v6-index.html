        <h1> Alone </h1>
        <div> 
            <p>From <strong>childhood's</strong> hour I have not been
              As others were I have not seen
              As others saw I could not bring
              My passions from a common spring</p> 
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p>From the same source I have not taken
                My <strong>sorrow</strong> I could not awaken
              My heart to joy at the same tone
              And all I lov'd I lov'd alone</p>
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p>Then in my <strong>childhood</strong> in the dawn 
                Of a most <strong>stormy</strong> life was drawn 
              From ev'ry depth of good and ill 
              The mystery which binds me still</p> 
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p>From the torrent, or the fountain 
                From the red <strong>cliff</strong> of the mountain 
              From the sun that 'round me roll'd</p> 
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p>In its autumn tint of gold 
                From the <strong>lightning</strong> in the sky 
              As it pass'd me flying by</p> 
        </div>
        <div> 
            <p>From the <strong>thunder</strong>, and the storm
              And the cloud that took the form 
              (When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
                Of a <strong>demon</strong> in my view.</p>
