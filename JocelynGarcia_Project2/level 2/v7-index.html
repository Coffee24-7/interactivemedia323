        <h1> Alone </h1>
        <div><p>From childhood's hour I have not been</p></div>
        <div><p>As others were I have not seen</p></div>
        <div><p>As others saw I could not bring</p></div> 
        <div><p>My passions from a common spring</p></div>
        <div><p>From the same source I have not taken</p></div>
        <div><p>My sorrow I could not awaken</p></div>
        <div><p>My heart to joy at the same tone</p><div>
        <div><p>And all I lov'd I lov'd <br><br><br>alone<br><br></p></div>
        <div><p>Then in my childhood in the dawn</p></div>
        <div><p>Of a most stormy life was drawn</p></div>
        <div><p>From ev'ry depth of good and ill</p></div>
        <div><p>The mystery which binds me still</p></div>
        <div><p>From the torrent, or the fountain</p></div>
        <div><p>From the red cliff of the mountain</p></div> 
        <div><p>From the sun that 'round me roll'd</p></div> 
        <div><p>In its autumn tint of gold</p></div> 
        <div><p>From the lightning in the sky</p></div> 
        <div><p>As it pass'd me flying by</p></div> 
        <div><p>From the thunder, and the storm</p></div> 
        <div><p>And the cloud that took the form</p></div> 
        <div><p>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</p></div> 
        <div><p>Of a demon in my view</p></div>
