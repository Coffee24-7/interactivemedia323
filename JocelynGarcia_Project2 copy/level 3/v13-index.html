            <p>My passions from a common spring <br> From the same source I have not taken <br> My sorrow I could not awaken</p> 
            
            <p>My heart to joy at the same tone <br> And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone <br> Then in my childhood in the dawn</p> 
            
            <p>Of a most stormy life was drawn <br> From ev'ry depth of good and ill <br> The mystery which binds me still</p> 
            
            <p>From the torrent, or the fountain <br> From the red cliff of the mountain <br> From the sun that 'round me roll'd</p>
            
            <p>In its autumn tint of gold <br> From the lightning in the sky <br> As it pass'd me flying by</p>
            
            <p>From the thunder, and the storm <br> And the cloud that took the form <br> (When the rest of Heaven was blue)</p> 
            
            <p>Of a demon in my view.</b></p>
